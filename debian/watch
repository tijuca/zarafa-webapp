# watch file for kopano-webapp from Kopano
#
# Kopano is mirroring some of there git trees on GitHub, so also kopano-webapp.
# That's makes it a lot easier to use uscan for tracking new upstream versions.
#
# Release Tags are currently not signed!
#
# Also there aren't any armored detached signing files (*.asc), thus we can't use
# any cryptographic signature verification and don't use 'pgpsigurlmangle'.
