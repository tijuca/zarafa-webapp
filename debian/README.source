non-free files:
===============
The upstream source contains some files we don't want because they are not
compatable with the Debian Free Software Guide. In detail there are javascript
files that are minimized, *.swf files and other files we have to filter out.

To get rid of these there is a file debian/create-upstream-tarball.sh that will
create a orig.tar.xz file from a given upstream file. This upstream source has
to be already downloaded. You can use uscan to download the upstream source.
The created *.orig.tar.xz will be placed one folder above the repository. Use
the script like:

  $ debian/create-upstream-tarball.sh /path/to/webapp-VERSION.tar.gz

The created cleaned *.orig.tar.xz can be used to be imported with
git-buildpackage.

  $ gbp import-orig --sign-tags [--verbose] ../zarafa-webapp_VERSION.orig.tar.xz

included tinymce parts:
=======================
The zarafa-webapp upstream source also contains files from the tinymce package
that lintian is of course complaining.

 W: zarafa-webapp: embedded-javascript-library usr/share/zarafa-webapp/client/tinymce/plugins/compat3x/tiny_mce_popup.js please use tinymce
 I: zarafa-webapp: font-in-non-font-package usr/share/zarafa-webapp/client/tinymce/skins/lightgray/fonts/tinymce-small.ttf
 I: zarafa-webapp: font-in-non-font-package usr/share/zarafa-webapp/client/tinymce/skins/lightgray/fonts/tinymce.ttf

These issues are not solvable right now as the Debian version of the package
tinymce is to old for linking, while writing version 3.8.4 Debian has
included.
There is a wishlist bug for updating the tinymce package. If the bug has
solved we can eleminate the warnings from lintian.
